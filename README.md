## My Problem Solving Process

### 1. Define the problem
- Skin the problem down to its backbone
	- Filter out the useless information from the original question and simplify it
- Re-iterate the problem with the new definition
	
### 2. Concept and Fundamental
- Note down any significant points on the first reading of the original problem
	- Making a highlight of the key concepts of the problem
- Verify the notes during the second reading of the simplified problem
	
### 3. Algorithmn 
- Classify the problem 
- Brainstorm possbile solutions
	- Imagine doing the cs program on paper
- Search for an appropriate algorithm
	- Check for:
		- Time complexity
		- Memory complexity
- Test the algorithmn with your test cases
- Note down potential problems you may encouter


### 4. Code
- Spending more time typing than thinking likely means that thereâ€™s not enough thought behind the code being written. 

### 5. Debug
- Ask the right questions why the program don't work. 
  - Example: Did I spell my output words correctly? 
    - Should of copy & pasted ^^
- Refer to potential problem list
- Make several test cases to help with debugging
